# ai-tools

Small command-line utilities for working with AI coding agents.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xafron-bv/ai-tools/main/install.sh | bash
```

This places each tool in `~/bin` and ensures `~/bin` is on your `PATH`
(by appending a guarded block to your shell rc — `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`,
`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish` depending
on `$SHELL`). Open a new shell afterwards, or `source` the file shown.

Override the install location with `AI_TOOLS_DEST=/some/dir`, or pin a
ref with `AI_TOOLS_REF=<branch-or-tag>`.

## Uninstall

```bash
ai-tools-uninstall
```

Or, if that script is gone:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xafron-bv/ai-tools/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Tools

### `tai`

Tail an AI agent log and narrate what's happening, one short sentence at
a time, using a fast model.

```bash
tai /path/to/agent.log
tai --mute /path/to/agent.log   # skip TTS even if tts-read is installed
```

Currently understands Claude Code stream-json logs (assistant text,
tool calls, tool results). Buffers events and flushes after a short
idle window, then asks `claude -p --model claude-haiku-4-5` to write a
single sentence describing what the agent is doing right now.

While events are buffered or the model is being called, a small
braille spinner is drawn on stderr (`buffering new log events…` →
`narrating (N new)`) so you can tell the tool is alive between
narration lines. The spinner is suppressed when stderr isn't a TTY.

If [`tts-read`](https://github.com/xafron-bv/tts-read) is on `PATH`,
each narration line is also piped to it (`echo "..." | tts-read`) so
you hear the description aloud. Pass `--mute` to disable.

Requirements: `jq`, the `claude` CLI on `PATH`. Optional: `tts-read`.

If `claude -p` doesn't return within `TAI_TIMEOUT` seconds (default
`45`), the call is killed and a warning is logged; the events stay in
the rolling context window so the next batch can still describe them.
The spinner shows elapsed seconds (`narrating (3 new) [12s]`) so a
slow model call doesn't look like a hang.

Env: `TAI_MODEL`, `TAI_IDLE`, `TAI_MAX_BUF`, `TAI_TIMEOUT`.

### `plan2pdf`

Convert an implementation plan into a self-contained PDF sized for a
Kindle Scribe (or comparable e-ink reader). The plan is rewritten by
`claude -p --model haiku --effort low` so it reads well **away from
the codebase**: file paths, line numbers, and copy-pasted hunks are
stripped and replaced with prose informed by what the code actually
does.

The rewrite is also tuned to be **text-to-speech friendly** — flowing
prose rather than telegraphic bullets, English where a code identifier
would otherwise live, transition sentences between phases, no
arrow/slash punctuation, and Mermaid diagrams only as visual
supplements (TTS skips them, so the surrounding prose stands alone).
The result reads aloud like a chapter of a technical audiobook.

```bash
plan2pdf plan.md                            # -> plan.pdf
plan2pdf plan.md -o ~/kindle/plan.pdf
plan2pdf plan.md --repo ~/devel/other-repo  # add another repo claude can read
cat plan.md | plan2pdf - -o plan.pdf        # read plan from stdin
plan2pdf plan.md -k                         # also keep the rewritten .md
```

Claude is given read access to the directory you run `plan2pdf` from
(`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`) so it can look up anything the plan
references and explain it in its own words. Pass `--repo <dir>` for
each additional directory the plan touches.

Mermaid diagrams in the plan (or in claude's rewrite) are rendered as
images in the PDF by `mermaid.js`, which headless Chrome loads from
jsDelivr at print time. An internet connection is required (`claude`
needs one too).

Requirements: `claude`, `pandoc`, `python3`, and a Chromium-based
browser — Google Chrome / Chromium / Brave / Microsoft Edge.

Env: `PLAN2PDF_MODEL`, `PLAN2PDF_EFFORT`, `PLAN2PDF_KEEP_MD`,
`PLAN2PDF_PAGE`, `PLAN2PDF_FONT`, `PLAN2PDF_FONTSIZE`,
`PLAN2PDF_TIMEOUT`, `PLAN2PDF_CHROME_TIMEOUT`,
`PLAN2PDF_ALLOWED_TOOLS`, `PLAN2PDF_DEBUG`.

## Adding a tool

1. Drop the script into `bin/` and `chmod +x` it.
2. Add its filename to `tools.txt`.
3. Document it in this README.

The installer reads `tools.txt`, so anything listed there is picked up
automatically on the next install.
